## 1. Pre - Image Process
Image processing program, for using images for deep learning.
Image is processed as array by using **numpy**. Image processing functions are from **Open CV 2**.

### 1) Rotate.py
Read image as open cv image. Rotate the image counterclockwise as much as _'degree'_ based on the **center** of the image.

And Save png file.

### 2) auto_resizing.py
Original Labeling, X-ray images are too big to process Deep Learning.

Change images size into (900 x _X_) or (_X_ x 900) pixels. (_X_ is equal or smaller than 900) 

ex) 2700 x 2700 -> 900 * 900  /  2700 * 1800 -> 900 * 600  /  1800 * 2700 -> 600 * 900

### 3) preprocessing.py
Make the item 2) more advanced and save the entire image inside the folder.

(Maximum pixel size : 256)
